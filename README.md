This repository contains the codes and documents for a project that I worked on in my college, aimed towards developing an Android application that discerns and detects an unknown touch on the smartphone screen based on various aspects of
the user's touch behavior. The app collects the data of a user's touch and leveraging machine learning classifiers, it detects whether the user is the owner of the device or not.
The development of android application was done in Java using Android Studio.
Machine Learning classifiers were written using Python and other ML Libraries on Jupyter Notebook.
